        <p>Let’s say you’re green, but not that green. Let’s say you want to learn more about GitHub, but can only
            find tutorials for either brand new users or advanced workflows for GitHub vets—nothing in between.</p>

        <p>That's where this page comes in.</p>

        <hr>

        <p>Stay with me for a minute.</p>

        <p>I think about naming conventions more than most people. This is a getting started guide, though that naming
            convention is imperfect. In this case, I’m assuming you know some things about GitHub, so you’re not really
            starting much of anything; you’re progressing with what you have. On the other hand, these aren’t advanced
            concepts. So what’s between GitHub fundamentals and incredibly technical matters? We're not getting started.
            We're getting going. </p>

        <p>Yes, we're getting going.</p>

        <p>Here, you're going to learn three fundamental workflows for using Git on the command line interface.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Assumptions</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>You're familiar with the GUI version of GitHub: GitHub Desktop</li>
            <li>You're on OSX.</li>
            <li>You can open Terminal or an alternative, like iTerm2.</li>
            <li>You have a repo with which you can experiment.</li>
            <li>You’re somewhat familiar with concepts that sound weirdly like throwing a frisbee with your dog:
                push, pull, fetch</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Scenario One: Place the files hosted in your GitHub repository onto your local machine </h3>

        <p>We want to take an already-existing repository and place it on your local machine. The good news is that
            you'll only have to do this once. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>In your browser, open the repository you want to download.</li>
            <li>Click <strong><b>Clone or download</b></strong>.</li>
            <li>Open Terminal and paste the following, replacing my dummy URL with your project URL:</li>
            <img src="copyURL.png" alt="">
        </ol>

        <pre><code class="language-git">$ git clone http://yourproject.com/coolRepo.git</code></pre>

        <p>This command deposits a clone of your repository in the /Users/ directory on your Mac.</p>

        <h3>Scenario Two: Update local repository to match what's on the server</h3>

        <p>This scenario is relevant if you’ve made a change to one of your files in GitHub itself and want to
            ensure you’re working locally with the most recent copy. This is rare, but good to know how to do. </p>

        <ol>
            <li>In your browser, visit the Github repository.</li>
            <li>Click <strong><b>Clone or download</b></strong>.</li>
            <li>Copy the URL.</li>
            <li>In Terminal, pull from the repository using this command, replacing my sample URL with the URL
                copied in step three.</li>
        </ol>

        <pre><code class="language-git"></code>$ git pull http://yourproject.com/coolRepo.git</code></pre>

        <h3>Scenario Three: Push changes to repository </h3>

        <p>You’ve made changes in your local environment and want to ensure your GitHub repo reflects them. This is the
            most common scenario.</p>

        <p>For context about why we're doing what we're doing, we need to understand what the staging area is.</p>

        <p>The staging area is a magical, liminal space where changes you've committed hang in the air, waiting for
            you to gently glide, er, push them into your repository.</p>

        <p>After making changes to a file locally, we want to place that file in the staging area. We can do this
            with $git add [file], but this alternative is more comprehensive:</p>

        <pre><code class="language-git"></code>git commit -a -m "message here"</code></pre>

        <p>We can ensure the changes we've placed in the staging areas are recognized by GitHub using:
            <pre><code class="language-git"></code>$ git status</code></pre>
            <p>If the file name is green, GitHub has recognized the change and is ready for you to push to the remote
                repository.</p>

            <ol>
                <li>To push to the repository, we only need:</li>
            </ol>
            <pre><code class="language-git">$ git push</code></pre>
            <hr>
            <p>GitHub can be a trip. </p>
            <p></p>Thinking about merges and branches and how they impact your repository through
            time can be as opaque as a later season of LOST. But these basic workflows will you going.</p>

Choices re: an imperative style vs. "we": I prefer the latter when writing content whose nature can be intimidating. The plural voice mimicks a hand-holding style of process oriented writing that I personally find helpful.
